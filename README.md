# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

This is my *third* challenge from Frontend Mentor.

I had **2 big issues** with this one.

- Grouping 2 of three elements in a row together while silmultaneously having the whole row justified and taking up the whole width of the container it is in

I haven't solved this one.

- Keeping the whole content vertically centered and then sticking the top of the main div to the top of the screen and enabling scrolling when the viewing height becomes too short to fit the screen without cutting away at the containers

I solved this by having conditional CSS that basically completely changes the rule set when the height of the screen changes beyond a set limit. This is definitely not an elegant solution. I'll be keeping my eyes open for something better.
